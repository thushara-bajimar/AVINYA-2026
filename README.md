## 🚨 About the Project

During a medical emergency, **every minute matters**.

A bystander may not know how to provide first aid, while a qualified person such as a doctor, medical student, or trained volunteer may be nearby but unaware that an emergency is taking place.

Traditional emergency response mainly focuses on connecting the person to professional services. However, there can still be a critical time gap between the **incident** and the **arrival of professional help**.

### 💡 AVINYA-2026 addresses this gap.

AVINYA is a **community-assisted emergency response platform** that connects a person facing an emergency with **nearby verified responders** who can potentially reach the incident location sooner and provide appropriate assistance while professional medical help is on the way.

---

# ✨ Why AVINYA?

### 🚑 Faster Local Assistance

Professional emergency services may take time to reach an incident.

AVINYA creates an additional layer of support by identifying **nearby available responders** who can be alerted to the emergency.

---

### 👨‍⚕️ Trusted Responder Network

Anyone should not be able to respond to a medical emergency through the platform.

Doctors, medical students, and approved volunteers undergo a **registration and verification process** before becoming eligible to receive emergency requests.

---

### 📍 Location-Aware Response

The emergency location is a critical part of the response.

AVINYA uses the incident location to identify responders in the surrounding area and help them reach the emergency site.

---

### 🔔 Real-Time Alerts

Instead of relying on a person to discover an emergency manually, the platform sends emergency requests to suitable nearby responders.

This turns the responder network into an **active, location-aware support system**.

---

### 🧠 Assistance While Waiting

The platform can provide emergency-specific first-aid guidance to the bystander, helping them take appropriate immediate steps while assistance is being arranged.

> AVINYA is designed as an **assistance and coordination platform**, not a replacement for professional medical care.

#  Response Engine

The response engine is the core of AVINYA.

When an emergency is created, the system:

```text
Emergency Created
       │
       ▼
Get Emergency Location
       │
       ▼
Find Available Verified Responders
       │
       ▼
Check Proximity / Estimated Travel Time
       │
       ▼
Send Alert
       │
       ├──────────────► Responder Accepts
       │                         │
       │                         ▼
       │                  Response Started
       │
       └──────────────► No Acceptance
                                 │
                                 ▼
                         Expand Search Radius
                                 │
                                 ▼
                         Alert More Responders
```

The system is designed so that **availability and estimated travel time** can be considered along with distance when selecting responders.

---

# 👨‍⚕️ Responder Verification

AVINYA separates **responder registration** from normal emergency usage.

### Registration Flow

```text
┌────────────────────┐
│ Responder Registers│
└──────────┬─────────┘
           ▼
┌────────────────────┐
│ Identity /         │
│ Credential Details │
└──────────┬─────────┘
           ▼
┌────────────────────┐
│ Verification       │
│ Process            │
└──────────┬─────────┘
           ▼
┌────────────────────┐
│ Admin Review       │
└──────────┬─────────┘
           ▼
┌────────────────────┐
│ Approved Responder │
└──────────┬─────────┘
           ▼
┌────────────────────┐
│ Eligible for       │
│ Emergency Alerts   │
└────────────────────┘
```

This helps create a responder network based on **verified participation rather than unrestricted access**.

# ⚙️ Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:

* Node.js
* npm
* Git

---

## 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thushara-bajimar/AVINYA-2026.git
cd AVINYA-2026
```

---

## 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

If the frontend and backend have separate package files, install dependencies in their respective directories as configured in the project.

### Optional Gemini guidance for “Other” emergencies

## 🔐 Gemini API Key Setup

The AI Assistant requires a Gemini API key. Each developer must use their own key.

### Steps

1. **Get a Gemini API key** from Google AI Studio.

2. **Open the main `AVINYA` folder** and create a `.env` file if it does not already exist.

3. Add your key:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

4. Make sure `.env` is included in `.gitignore` so the key is **not pushed to GitHub**.




### Important

* Never commit or share your actual API key.
* `.env.example` is provided as a template.
* Each team member should create their **own `.env`** and add their own Gemini API key.
* Restart the project after adding or changing the API key.

## 3️⃣ Start the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

The terminal will display the local development URL.




# 🔐 Security & Privacy

AVINYA handles emergency and responder-related information carefully.

The system is designed around:

*  Verified responder access
*  Controlled responder registration
*  Restricted emergency information
*  Camera-based identity verification
*  Separation of responder and bystander workflows

### Development Storage

The current MVP is designed for **local development and demonstration**.

Uploaded verification files and development database data are stored in the configured local application environment and should not be treated as production-grade cloud storage.

For production deployment, secure cloud storage, encryption, authentication, access control, auditing, and appropriate data-retention policies would be required.

---

# 🌍 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

AVINYA supports the following **United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)** through its approach to community-based emergency response:

### 🏥 SDG 3 - Good Health and Well-being

Supports timely emergency assistance by connecting people in distress with nearby verified responders and providing context-aware first-aid guidance while professional help is being coordinated.

### 💡 SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure

Supports innovative emergency-response infrastructure through digital alerts, real-time location tracking, ETA-based responder matching, and dynamic search-radius expansion.

### 🏙️ SDG 11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities

Supports safer and more resilient communities by enabling location-aware coordination between people seeking help and nearby verified responders.

### 🤝 SDG 17 - Partnerships for the Goals

Encourages coordination among responders, volunteers, institutions, and existing emergency services to strengthen community-level emergency response.

> **Through these contributions, AVINYA aims to make emergency assistance more accessible, coordinated, and responsive through technology and community participation.**

---

# 🌱 Future Scope

AVINYA can evolve into a larger emergency-response ecosystem.

### ☁️ Cloud Deployment

Move from local MVP infrastructure to scalable cloud services.

### 🗺️ Road-Based Routing

Use actual road networks instead of relying only on straight-line geographical distance.

### 🚦 Traffic-Aware ETA

Consider real-time traffic conditions when estimating responder arrival time.

### 💊 Nearby Medical Stores

Display nearby medical stores and pharmacies to help users quickly locate essential medicines and emergency supplies when required.

### 📱 Mobile Application

Provide dedicated Android and iOS applications for faster emergency access.

### 🔴 Live Location Sharing

Allow responders and relevant emergency participants to share live movement during an active response.

### 🚑 Emergency Service Integration

Future versions could integrate directly with ambulance and emergency service systems.

### 🏥 Healthcare Integration

Potential integration with hospitals and healthcare providers can be explored in future versions.

### 🌐 Multi-Language Support

Support multiple Indian languages to improve accessibility.

### 📶 Low-Connectivity Support

Optimize emergency communication for areas with unreliable network connectivity.

---

# 🎯 Vision

> **"When an emergency happens, help should not depend only on how quickly an ambulance can arrive."**

AVINYA envisions a connected community where **verified people with relevant training can become an additional layer of emergency support**.

The goal is not to replace ambulances, doctors, or hospitals.

The goal is to **bridge the critical gap before professional help arrives.**
